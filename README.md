### Hi there 👋

<!--
# HI EVERYONE!(⌐■_■)

Call me just a husk, because i don't care🗿🗿🗿

I'm a beginner software developer. I don't know so much about the programming and computer science, but i should learn more and it's my goal🏆🏆🏆

Basicly, i know C++, OOP, Algorithms and Data Structures, and a few python with assembly🤓

At the moment i've done some litle projects. There is a one-neuron net, and a device that based on Arduino. All of this i wrote on C++.

Some facts about myself: 
- 📖If i need to make something intresting i can work with it for the long time.
- 🚊I like to travel and learn something new.
- 🎧Listen to musik it's my favorite thing, because when i do this, i fell much better. Do you wanna listenning to [musik with me](https://open.spotify.com/user/31prg5kvvxwv736oczg6ertbizxa?si=33e8daeed7ea4e5a)?
